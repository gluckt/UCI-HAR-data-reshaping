# UCI-HAR-data-reshaping #
This repo contains the following files:
  * /UCI HAR Dataset/: folder containing raw data
  * /run_analysis.R: script that generates a new dataset from the original data that is tidy and ready for analysis
  * /CodeBook.md: Codebook containing background information on data and describing each variable in tidy dataset
  * /HARtidy.txt: tidy dataset generated by run_analysis.R
  * /README.md: this
  
There is only one script (run_analysis.R) that does all the analysis on the provided UCI HAR Dataset. 
It combines and organizes the training and test data into one dataset. It then selects measurements of mean or standard deviation and creates an independent dataset of averages of the selected means and standard deviations for each combination of subject and activity. This new dataset meets the tidy data standards as described in Hadley Wickham's [Tidy Data](http://example.com/ "Title")<sup>[1]</sup>.


Note that is it in the "narrow" form as opposed to the "wide" form. Although the "wide" form may be more popular this still adheres to the requirements for tidy data as each column coressponds to one variable and each row is one observation.
