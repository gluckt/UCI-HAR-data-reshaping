# UCI-HAR-data-reshaping #
This repo contains the following files:
  * /UCI HAR Dataset/: folder containing raw data
  * /run_analysis.R: script that generates a new dataset from the original data that is tidy and ready for analysis
  * /CodeBook.md: Codebook containing background information on data and describing each variable in tidy dataset
  * /README.md: this
  
There is only one script (run_analysis.R) that does all the analysis on the provided UCI HAR Dataset. 
It combines and organizes the training and test data and generates a data text file of an independent dataset that meets the tidy data standards as described in Hadley Wickham's "Tidy Data"<sup>[1]</sup>.
